# tensor

**Inspired by Andrej Karpathy's implementation of 1D tensors,  I implemented n-dimensional tensors. Since I am not sure whether a PR (pull request) is needed, I did not submit a PR to his repository. To maintain the integrity of a single file, I did not reuse some code; instead, I copied it directly.**
